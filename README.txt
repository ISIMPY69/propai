PropAI Landing Page
-------------------

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- /assets/logo.png (or logo.svg)

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html in any browser to preview.
2. To accept form submissions in production, replace the form handler in script.js
   with a POST to your Zapier webhook, Make/Integromat webhook, or a Google Forms endpoint.
3. To deploy:
   - Host on Netlify/Vercel by pointing to the folder.
   - Or upload to any static host / S3 + CloudFront.
4. Update the Calendly link and contact email in index.html to your real links.

Notes:
- This is a static landing page meant for quick pilots and demos.
- If you want, I can wire the form to a Zapier webhook (I'll provide the webhook code and instructions).
